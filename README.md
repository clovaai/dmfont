### Abstract

Generating a new font library is a very labor-intensive and time-consuming job for glyph-rich scripts. Despite the remarkable success of existing font generation methods, they have significant drawbacks; they require a large number of reference images to generate a new font set, or they fail to capture detailed styles with a few samples. In this paper, we focus on compositional scripts, a widely used letter system in the world, where each glyph can be decomposed by several components. By utilizing the compositionality of compositional scripts, we propose a novel font generation framework, named Dual Memory-augmented Font Generation Network (DM-Font), which enables us to generate a high-quality font library with only a few samples. We employ memory components and global-context awareness in the generator to take advantage of the compositionality. In the experiments on Korean-handwriting fonts and Thai-printing fonts, we observe that our method generates a significantly better quality of samples with faithful stylization compared to the state-of-the-art generation methods in quantitatively and qualitatively.

## Installation

Install dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note that using different version of required packages can effects the results, especially PyTorch. The implementations are tested on Python 3.6.

## Dataset preparation

### Data sources

Korean-handwriting and Thai-printing datasets were built from [UhBee fonts](http://uhbeefont.com/) and [Thai font collection](https://github.com/jeffmcneill/thai-font-collection), respectively.
To ensure the style diversity of the dataset, one font was selected for each font family in our experiments.

### Dumping dataset

The `scripts/prepare_dataset.py` script renders glyphs from the collected ttf fonts and dumps them into hdf5 files.
For the Thai-printing dataset, we rectify the rendering errors using [raqm](https://github.com/HOST-Oman/libraqm).
It should be installed before making dataset.

- Korean-handwriting

```
python -m scripts.prepare_dataset kor $FONTSDIR meta/kor_split.json $DUMPDIR
```

- Thai-printing

```
python -m scripts.prepare_dataset thai $FONTSDIR meta/thai_split.json $DUMPDIR
```

## How to run

### Pretrained models

For convenience, the minimal size checkpoints are provided by excluding training variables, e.g., momentums in optimizer, discriminator, or non-EMA generator.
